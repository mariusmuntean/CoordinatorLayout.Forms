## CoordinatorLayout.XamarinForms

A custom control for Xamarin.Forms, that shows an expanding top view and a scrollable bottom view. It is a reproduction of Android's CoordinatorLayout - https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/coordinatorlayout


Here's a quick rundown of the control's features:

* Customizable border color and thickness
* Shadow
* Rounded corner with variable radius
* Custom view as border background. Look at the sample to get an idea.
